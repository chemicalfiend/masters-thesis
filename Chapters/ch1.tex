\section{Semiconductor Materials}

%What are semiconductors and why are they cool

%Photovoltaics and their importance in modern context of energy materials

%Why Organic photovoltaics are taking off.

%Electrons in a solid, Kronnig-Penny for demonstrating bands

%Mobility, Einstein-Smoluchowski Relation.


\section{Electronic Structure}

The electronic structure is the solution of the quantum states of electrons in a given chemical system. Typically, this involves determining the energies and wavefunctions of the various states. This can be done by solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for molecules.

% Tight-binding

% DFT, TD-DFT


\section{Phonons}

% What are phonons

% Sample phonon dispersion in a solid.

% Why treating el-ph interactions in solids is important.
