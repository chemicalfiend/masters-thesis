\lhead{Appendix B. \emph{Spectral Line Broadening}} % Change X to a consecutive letter; this is for the header on each page - perhaps a shortened title


To approximate the line shape of a discrete spectrum when measured experimentally, we broaden the spectral lines using various methods.

% Mention how Gaussian misses anharmonic effects which Lorentzian can incorporate which is really important
